Official website for the MIT Video Game Orchestra.

1. I think it’d be nice to have profiles for current members, and maybe alumni? Perhaps including the following: name, picture, time in VGO, and some facts (music or video game related) and/or a short intro? Once we’ve decided on what exactly, we want we can email all members and ask them for data. We can come back to this.

2. There could be an “About VGO” / “contact us” page? As a place holder, you can use this (from our dorm spam):
The MIT Video Game Orchestra is a student ensemble dedicated to playing original arrangements of video game music. Consisting of strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion, and drums/guitar/bass, we play a wide variety of video game music. All our arrangements are written by members of the orchestra and are tailored for the group. We always encourage members to exercise their arranging and orchestration skills! Outside of rehearsal, we have lots of fun too :)
Please email vgo-exec@mit.edu if you have any questions.

3. There could also be a news / events page? Maybe we can write a blurb about our arranging workshops or something. Larry should also have pictures. When we have dates for Boba sales and performances, we can put those here, too.

4. There should also be a sort of “Gallery” page for music/arrangements etc.. For now we can use the YouTube playlist I made for the current semester: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwz-H-GKSNroUflilfkaFpZ7QZWpRn8En
Is there a way to embed a YouTube playlist or individual YouTube videos on the page? I’ll work on making a better playlist.

5. There should be a homepage, obviously, but what should be on there? Maybe the news / events page should be the homepage? Unsure…
